This project introduces an application aimed at preserving the privacy and data security of Steam users. Our goal is to enable users to securely manage and control their data while prioritizing user consent and security.

## Features

- **Privacy-Focused Data Collection:** The application collects data in compliance with the platform's terms of use.

- **Data Security:** User data is directly obtained from the Steam platform, and data is not stored, copied, or distributed.

- **User Control:** Users directly access data through the Steam application, and there is no collection, processing, transmission, storage, etc., of data involved. (This rule may be flexible for the Steam Game Config Cloud Pool in future versions)

- **Keeping Updated:** The application has been designed to adapt to changes in data security standards and platform policies (Year of Reference: 2023).
